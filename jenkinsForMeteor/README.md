# Introduction
This container is an extension of the jenkins public container. This container main goal is to give a solution to build, test and deploy meteor projects. In the following sections I will show some example how you can use this container and different tests systems to use BDD, TDD, continuous integration and deployment for your app.

# What is the difference between this container and the original?

Okay, so basically this container only contains just some extensions which needed for running meteor tests and deploy the application somewhere:
* nodejs
* meteor
* chimp
* spacejam
* coffee-script
* jshint
* csslint
